NAME
====

paths - A fast recursive file / directory finder

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use paths;

.say for paths;                             # all files from current directory

.say for paths($dir);                       # all files from $dir

.say for paths(:dir(* eq '.git'));          # files in ".git" directories

.say for paths(:file(*.ends-with(".json");  # all .json files

.say for paths(:recurse);                   # also recurse in non-accepted dirs

.say for paths(:follow-symlinks);           # also recurse into symlinked dirs

.say for paths(:!file);                     # only produce directory paths

say is-regular-file('/etc/passwed');        # True (on Unixes)
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

By default exports two subroutines: `paths` (returning a `Seq` of absolute path strings of files (or directories) for the given directory and all its sub-directories (with the notable exception of `.` and `..`).

And `is-regular-file`, which returns a `Bool` indicating whether the given absolute path is a regular file.

SELECTIVE IMPORTING
===================

```raku
use paths <paths>;  # only export sub paths
```

By default all utility functions are exported. But you can limit this to the functions you actually need by specifying the names in the `use` statement.

To prevent name collisions and/or import any subroutine with a more memorable name, one can use the "original-name:known-as" syntax. A semi-colon in a specified string indicates the name by which the subroutine is known in this distribution, followed by the name with which it will be known in the lexical context in which the `use` command is executed.

```raku
use path <paths:find-all-paths>;  # export "path-exists" as "alive"

.say for find-all-paths;
```

EXPORTED SUBROUTINES
====================

paths
-----

The `paths` subroutine returns a `Seq` of absolute path strings of files for the given directory and all its sub-directories (with the notable exception of `.` and `..`).

### ARGUMENTS

  * directory

The only positional argument is optional: it can either be a path as a string or as an `IO` object. It defaults to the current directory (also when an undefined value is specified. The (implicitely) specified directory will **always** be investigated, even if the directory name does not match the `:dir` argument.

If the specified path exists, but is not a directory, then only that path will be produced if the file-matcher accepts the path. In all other cases, an empty `Seq` will be returned.

  * :dir

The named argument `:dir` accepts a matcher to be used in smart-matching with the basename of the directories being found. If accepted, will produce both files as well as other directories to recurse into.

It defaults to skipping all of the directories that start with a period (also if an undefined value is specified).

  * :file

The named argument `:file` accepts a matcher to be used in smart-matching with the basename of the file being found. It defaults to `True`, meaning that all possible files will be produced (also if an undefined values is specified).

If the boolean value `False` is specified, then **only** the paths of directories will be produced.

  * :recurse

Flag. The named argument `:recurse` accepts a boolean value to indicate whether subdirectories that did **not** match the `:dir` specification, should be investigated as well for other **directories** to recurse into. No files will be produced from a directory that didn't match the `:dir` argument.

By default, it will not recurse into directories.

  * :follow-symlinks

The named argument `:follow-symlinks` accepts a boolean value to indicate whether subdirectories, that are actually symbolic links to a directory, should be investigated as well. By default, it will not.

is-regular-file
---------------

```raku
say is-regular-file('/etc/passwed');  # True (on Unixes)
```

Returns a `Bool` indicating whether the given absolute path is a regular file.
